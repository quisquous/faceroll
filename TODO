* basic warrior rotation (just data struct)
* basic validator for struct
* potency calculator for struct
* pretty html printing of rotations

* for X length of fight, determine best cooldown usage
* insert group buff ogcds as well

From there:
* monk next (probably), then other classes
* consider multiple mobs
* consider boss factors (e.g. totally invulnerable, dots ticking but not targetable, targetable but invulnerable, etc)
* consider real values (ss, crit, det, and get real damage values)
